auto -> replaces position node
manual -> sets auto/manual on the mode topic => 1: auto , 0: manual
communication -> combines everything and send it to the arduino

waste_data
check_user -> run once on start

-Topics-
image -> image from camera is sent
detect -> flag sent to pause or play model
position -> width height and distance from center of frame info sent
class_info -> class of the object detected is sent
mode -> auto or manual
control -> from auto to communication (contains [ahead/rotate, bin_section])

-Publishers-
image_pub -> on the image topic
pos_pub -> on the position topic
class_pub -> on the class_info node

-Subscribers-
image_sub -> on the image topic
detect_sub -> on the detect topic
pos_sub -> on the position topic

-ARRAY-

* the array for auto and manual will be slightly different

* For auto:
[auto/manual, ahead/rotate, distance or angle value, bin_section]
[2 states, 3 states, 4 states]
[
    auto/manual:
    1 is auto
    0 is manual,

    ahead/rotate:
    0 is do nothing and go to next
    1 is go ahead and return to ml node
    2 is rotate and return to ml node,

    distance or angle value:
    float value of distance or angle

    bin_section:
    0 is skip
    1 is section 1
    2 is section 2
    3 is section 3
    4 is section 4,
]

* For manual:
[auto/manual, action]
[2 states, 3 states, 4 states]
[
    auto/manual:
    1 is auto
    0 is manual,

    action:
    w -> forward
    a -> left
    s -> back
    d -> rigth

    1 -> section 1 of bin
    2 -> section 2 of bin
    3 -> section 3 of bin
    4 -> section 4 of bin

    l -> lid open
    k -> lid close

    z -> left claw open
    x -> left claw close

    c -> right claw open
    v -> right claw close

    bin_section:
    1 is section 1
    2 is section 2
    3 is section 3
    4 is section 4,
]

-NOTE-
* Add the following line to the setup.cfg file in your each of your packages:

[build_scripts]
executable = /usr/bin/env python3

* This is in order to include the python from your virtual environment

-ISSUES-
* In Manual mode the position topic will still be recieving data although unsed

-TODO-
* Add bin section in ml node (in the get largest function)
* Cap stepper motor to only turn 360 deg and always return to default position before shutdown
